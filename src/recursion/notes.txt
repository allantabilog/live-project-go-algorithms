Knight's tour problem
- use recursion to reduce (drastically) the solution space
- in this live project - data representation using slices (to model the board)
    and structs (to model offsets, i.e. allowed moves relative to current position)
- note the board in the project is 8x8 but can be generalised
    - the illustration shows a 5x5 board
